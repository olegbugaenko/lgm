- Health/Happiness mechanism:
[starting from 500 population need additional sources of health and happiness]
[i.e Health debuff = 1/(1+Math.max(0, ((population - 500)/300))) - debuff to birthRate]
[i.e Health debuff = 1/(1+Math.max(0, ((population - 500)/500)^0.75)) - debuff to effiency]
[i.e Happiness debuff = 1/(1+Math.max(0, ((population - 500)/500)^0.75)) - debuff to effiency]
For balance include mechanics that would consume more food for happiness/health
- War:
Starting from wheel and having at least one mine can build barracks. Each worker in barrack is a soldier.
People from barracks consume x2 food
People at war consume metal and wood. When metal and wood is over - battle is automatically paused.
As battle finished - troops going automatically to next battle, until territory can be captured.
